# Cafe Management System

Welcome to the Cafe Management System! This web application is an end-to-end solution built using Node.js, Express, MySQL, ejs, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was inspired to create this project after visiting a night canteen in my college, where I noticed their billing system was a desktop application. Leveraging my web development skills, I completed this project in just 24 days, and I've since made functionality improvements, UI enhancements, and bug fixes.

This project has been a tremendous learning experience, allowing me to apply the theoretical knowledge I've gained throughout my web development journey.
